# Nœuds

The Nodes screen displays all devices visible on your mesh network.

## Node List

The node list shows every node your radio has heard, including:

- **Node name** — user-configured long name
- **Short name** — 4-character identifier
- **Signal quality** — last heard signal strength
- **Last heard** — time since last communication
- **Distance** — estimated distance (if positions are shared)
- **Battery** — remote node battery level (if telemetry is enabled)

### Node Status Indicators

### Node Roles

Nodes can be configured with different roles that affect their mesh behavior:

| Rôle                             | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Base Client                      | Treats favorited-node traffic as Router Late priority; all other traffic as Client                                                                     |

| Routeur avec retard              | Infrastructure node that rebroadcasts once, but only after all other modes (provides supplemental coverage)                         |
| ~~Router Client~~                | ⚠️ **Deprecated** (removed in firmware 2.3.15) — no longer selectable; use Router or Client instead |

| Capteur                          | Optimized for telemetry reporting                                                                                                                      |

### Choosing a Role

Most users should keep the default **Client** role. Consider a different role when:

- **Router** — You have a node in a fixed, elevated location with reliable power (rooftop, hilltop). Routers stay awake continuously to relay messages for others and are essential for extending mesh coverage. Don't use Router on battery-powered handheld devices.
- **Router Late** — An infrastructure node that always rebroadcasts packets once but only after all other routing modes have had their turn. Provides supplemental coverage for local clusters without competing with primary routers.
- **Client Base** — Treats traffic from/to your favorited nodes with Router Late priority (ensuring those messages get extra relay coverage) while handling everything else as a normal Client.
- **Client Mute** — You want to receive mesh traffic but not contribute to relaying. Useful for monitoring-only devices or to reduce congestion in dense areas.
- **Tracker** — An unattended device whose sole purpose is broadcasting its GPS position (e.g., a vehicle, pet, or asset). Sleeps between broadcasts to conserve battery.
- **Sensor** — An unattended device reporting environmental telemetry (temperature, humidity, air quality). Similar power profile to Tracker.
- **TAK / TAK Tracker** — Only needed if interoperating with ATAK/WinTAK systems. See [TAK Integration](tak) for details.

> 💡 **Tip:** The mesh works best when most nodes are **Client** or **Router**. Too many Mute nodes reduces mesh resilience; too many Routers in a dense area can cause congestion. A good rule of thumb: one Router per 5–10 Clients in your area.

### Encryption Indicators

Nodes display encryption status icons next to their name:

| Icon        | Meaning                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔒 Locked   | Communication uses PKI (public key infrastructure) — end-to-end encrypted with verified identity |
| 🔓 Unlocked | Communication uses shared channel PSK — encrypted but identity not individually verified                            |
| ⚠️ Mismatch | Public key mismatch — the node's key has changed since last seen (investigate before trusting)   |

> 💡 **Tip:** PKI encryption (firmware 2.5+) provides stronger security than channel PSK because each node has a unique key pair. If you see a key mismatch warning, the node may have been reset or compromised.
