# Desktop App

The Meshtastic Desktop application shares its core codebase with Android via Kotlin Multiplatform. Most features work identically on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Installation

### Linux

- Download the `.deb` or `.AppImage` package from the releases page
- Or build from source using `./gradlew :desktopApp:run`

### macOS

- Download the `.dmg` package from releases
- Or build from source

### Windows

- Download the `.msi` installer from releases
- Or build from source

## Connecting Your Radio

### USB Serial (Primary)

The most reliable connection method on Desktop:

1. Connect your Meshtastic radio via USB cable.
2. The app should detect the serial port automatically.
3. If not detected, select the correct serial port from the Connect menu.

### TCP/IP

For network-connected radios:

1. Enter the radio's IP address and port (default: 4403).
2. Click **Connect**.

### Bluetooth (BLE)

Bluetooth Low Energy is supported on Desktop via the [Kable](https://github.com/JuulLabs/kable) library:

1. Ensure your system has a Bluetooth adapter.
2. The app scans for nearby Meshtastic radios automatically.
3. Select your device from the Connect screen.

\*Chirpy AI requires Android 14+ on Google flavor builds with supported hardware.

†App Functions exposes app actions to the Android system AI on Google flavor builds. See [App Functions](app-functions).

## UI Differences

The Desktop app uses the same Compose Multiplatform UI with adaptations for larger screens and desktop interaction.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

All shortcuts use the **Meta** key — that's ⌘ (Command) on macOS and the Super / Windows key on Linux and Windows. (`Ctrl` is not bound.)

| Shortcut   | Action                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| **Meta+Q** | Quit the application   |
| **Meta+,** | Open Settings          |
| **Meta+1** | Switch to Messages tab |
| **Meta+2** | Switch to Nodes tab    |
| **Meta+3** | Switch to Map tab      |
| **Meta+4** | Switch to Connect tab  |
| **Meta+/** | Open About             |

### Window & System Tray

- **Window resizing** — responsive layout adapts to window dimensions
- **System tray** — minimize to system tray for background mesh operation
- **Tray menu** — right-click the tray icon to show window or quit
- **Mouse interaction** — hover states and standard desktop navigation

### Notification Preferences

The Desktop app provides in-app toggles for controlling which notifications are shown — messages, new nodes, and low battery alerts. Access these from **Settings → Notifications** within the app.

## Built-in Documentation Browser

The Desktop app includes a built-in documentation browser for quick access to help content without leaving the application.

The browser supports full-text search across all documentation:

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-Android.git
cd Meshtastic-Android
./gradlew :desktopApp:run
```

Requirements:

- JDK 21
- No Android SDK required for desktop-only builds

## Known Limitations

- The interactive map view is Android-only — the Map tab is present but does not render a map on desktop
- Some Android-specific features (widgets, specific notification channels) are unavailable
- Performance may vary on low-spec hardware running Compose Desktop
- BLE bonding is not yet supported on desktop (pairing works without bonding)
