# TAK Integration

Meshtastic integrates with the Team Awareness Kit (TAK) ecosystem, enabling interoperability between Meshtastic nodes and TAK applications like ATAK and WinTAK.

## Overview

The TAK module allows Meshtastic nodes to:
- Share position data in TAK-compatible CoT (Cursor on Target) format
- Appear as team members on TAK map displays
- Receive TAK PLI (Position Location Information) messages

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- ATAK (Android Team Awareness Kit), iTAK, or WinTAK installed
- Your node's **Device Role** (Device configuration) set to **TAK** or **TAK Tracker** — this is what makes the
  TAK module appear in Module configuration at all
- Firmware 2.8.0 or newer on the node. Earlier firmware accepts a TAK config write and never
  stores it, so the app hides the TAK module entry below that version even when the role is set
  correctly. See [Firmware Updates](firmware)

> ⚠️ **Warning:** The old **Meshtastic ATAK Plugin** is no longer part of this path and cannot
> work. It bridged through the cross-process AIDL API, which was removed in app 2.8.0; the mesh
> service runs in-process only. Do not install it. Interop runs over the app's own local
> TAK server plus the Mesh to CoT Converter, both described in the following sections, with stock ATAK/iTAK/WinTAK.

### Configuration

Navigate to **Settings → Module configuration → TAK (ATAK)**. The module's own settings are your TAK identity —
there is no separate enable switch here, because the **Device Role** setting in Device configuration is what
turns TAK on. Your node broadcasts this identity, which appears on TAK maps.

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Role | Your operational role within the team: Team Member, Team Lead, HQ, Sniper, Medic, Forward Observer, RTO, or K9 | Default (Team Member) |
| Team | Your team color on the TAK map, one of the 14 standard TAK team colors such as Blue, Red, Cyan, or Green | Default (Cyan) |

Your TAK callsign isn't a separate setting. The firmware uses your node's long name.

Team colors are the standard TAK team colors, so coordinate with your TAK team to use consistent team assignments.

### Local TAK Server

The app can also run a **local TAK server** so ATAK on the **same phone**, or WinTAK on the same computer running the desktop app, can connect directly without a remote TAK server. The server binds to localhost only (`127.0.0.1:8089`) and uses TLS with mutual certificate authentication (mTLS), so it is not reachable from other devices on the network.

Open **Settings → Advanced → TAK Server**. These are app settings stored on this phone, which is why they sit next to **Firmware Update** and **Debug Panel** rather than under the TAK module config — and why they need neither a TAK role nor firmware 2.8.0. On Android 17 and newer, turning the server on asks for the local network permission it needs to open its socket. If that permission is denied for good, the app turns the server back off and offers to open app settings:

- **Enable Local TAK Server** — starts the loopback-only mTLS server on port **8089** for ATAK connections from the same device.
- **Status** — under the toggle: *Off*, *Starting TAK Server*, *Listening on 127.0.0.1:8089 — waiting for ATAK*, the count of local client connections, or *Unable to start TAK Server. Turn it off and on to retry.*
- **TAK Mesh Channel** — selects which Meshtastic channel outgoing TAK traffic is sent on (default: the primary channel, index 0). Incoming TAK traffic is accepted from any channel. Matches the equivalent setting on iOS and in the legacy ATAK plugin.
- **Mesh to CoT Converter** — off by default, and shown under the server toggle. With the server
  running, this synthesizes a CoT contact for every node in your node database, so ordinary
  Meshtastic nodes appear on the ATAK map as contacts. **This is what replaced the old plugin's
  node visibility** — without it, only TAK-role nodes show up. When the connected node runs
  firmware older than 2.8.0, a notice under the switch says that only location and chat messages
  bridge to ATAK.
- **Export TAK Data Package** — generates a `.zip` data package that ATAK can import to connect to this server. The share icon in the top bar does the same.

## TAK Roles

Nodes configured with TAK-related roles behave differently from standard clients:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **TAK** | For a node paired with an ATAK device. Turns off many routine broadcasts to favor the CoT packet stream. |
| **TAK Tracker** | Broadcasts TAK PLI automatically, at the interval set by the position configuration, and turns off many routine broadcasts. Suited to unattended position beacons such as vehicles and equipment. |

> 💡 **Tip:** Use **TAK Tracker** for devices that only need to report position (e.g., a node mounted in a vehicle). Use **TAK** for devices where users actively participate in TAK operations.

### CoT (Cursor on Target) Format

TAK messages use the Cursor on Target XML format — a military standard for sharing situational awareness data. Meshtastic converts its internal protobuf messages to CoT format when bridging to TAK systems, so no manual format conversion is needed.

## Wire Format (V1 / V2)

Meshtastic supports two TAK wire formats, chosen automatically based on the connected node's firmware — no manual configuration needed:

| Format | Compatibility | Features |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| V1 (Legacy) | Firmware 2.7.x and older | Bare protobuf encoding on port 72. Supports position sharing (PLI) and chat (GeoChat) only — shapes, markers, routes, and other typed CoT events are dropped |
| V2 (Current) | Firmware 2.8.0+ | Compact, zstd-compressed encoding on port 78. Adds shapes, markers, routes, aircraft, casevac, emergency, and task CoT types on top of everything V1 supports |

A node still relays legacy V1 packets from older nodes even while running V2 itself, so mixed-firmware meshes keep working.

## Usage with ATAK

Once configured:
- Meshtastic nodes appear as markers on the ATAK map with callsign labels
- Chat messages can bridge between mesh and TAK networks
- Position updates flow bidirectionally between Meshtastic and TAK
- TAK Tracker nodes broadcast PLI automatically — their positions appear on ATAK maps without any ATAK-side configuration
- On Android, routes received from the mesh are also saved as a data package (`.zip`) in **Downloads**; import it in ATAK to add the route. An update to the same route overwrites its file rather than adding a copy. After the app is reinstalled, the first update to a route saves one renamed copy, and later updates overwrite that. On Android 9 and older the file goes to the app's own folder under `Android/data` instead. The desktop app doesn't save route files

> ℹ️ **Note:** TAK integration requires specific node roles. Standard client nodes don't automatically participate in TAK operations — though with **Mesh to CoT Converter** enabled they still appear on the ATAK map as contacts.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Node doesn't appear on ATAK map | Wrong Device Role setting, or Mesh to CoT Converter off | Set the node's **Device Role** to TAK or TAK Tracker. For ordinary (non-TAK-role) nodes to appear, also enable **Mesh to CoT Converter** under **Settings → Advanced → TAK Server** |
| Position updates are stale | GPS fix lost or interval too long | Check GPS status; reduce position broadcast interval in Position Config |
| ATAK shows "disconnected" | The local TAK server is off, or ATAK is pointed elsewhere | Check **Enable Local TAK Server** is on, and that ATAK is connecting to `127.0.0.1:8089` — re-import the exported data package if unsure |
| Shapes, markers, or routes not bridging | Sending node is on legacy V1 (firmware 2.7.x or older) | Update the sending node's firmware to 2.8.0+ for V2 wire format |
| CoT data not flowing | Channel mismatch | All TAK nodes must be on the same channel with matching encryption |

## Security Considerations

> 🔒 **Privacy:** TAK data shares your position and callsign information. The TAK module respects
> the same channel encryption as other Meshtastic messages — in sensitive environments, use a
> channel with a non-default key.
