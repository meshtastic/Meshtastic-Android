# Persistence

How the Meshtastic app stores data across different mechanisms.

## Room KMP Database

**Module:** `core:database`

The primary structured data store:
- Node information and history
- Message history
- Waypoints
- Telemetry data
- Channel configurations

### Key Points

- Uses Room KMP for cross-platform compatibility
- Migrations managed through Room's built-in migration system
- DAO interfaces live in `core:database`
- Repository layer in `core:repository` provides the public API

### What's Stored in Room

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `NodeEntity` | All known mesh nodes and their metadata |
| `MyNodeEntity` | The local node's own info |
| `Packet` | Message history (channel and direct), waypoints, and telemetry data |
| `ContactSettings` | Per-contact mute and read-state |
| `ReactionEntity` | Emoji reactions on messages |
| `MeshLog` | Raw mesh protocol logs |
| `MetadataEntity` | Device metadata (firmware version, hardware model) |
| `QuickChatAction` | User-configured quick-chat messages |
| `DeviceHardwareEntity` | Cached device hardware catalog |
| `FirmwareReleaseEntity` | Cached firmware release info |
| `TracerouteNodePositionEntity` | Traceroute hop position data |

> 💡 **Note:** Waypoints, telemetry, and channel data are stored within the `Packet` entity (using the `port_num` field to distinguish packet types) rather than in separate tables.

## DataStore Preferences

**Module:** `core:datastore`

For lightweight key-value preferences:
- Local radio configuration (LocalConfig proto)
- Module configuration (ModuleConfig proto)
- Channel set data
- Local statistics
- Recently connected device addresses

## Core Prefs

**Module:** `core:prefs`

Higher-level preferences abstraction:
- User-facing settings
- App behavior configuration
- Feature toggles

## What Docs Intentionally Skip

The `feature:docs` module does **not** use Room or any persistent database:
- Documentation content is packaged as build-time assets
- The docs corpus is versioned with the app binary
- No migration story is needed for docs content
- Optional UX state (last viewed page) could use `core:prefs` but is not part of the docs data model

This is an intentional design decision to keep documentation:
- Fully offline without database overhead
- Replaceable with each app update
- Simple to validate and test

## Best Practices

- Use Room for structured, queryable data that changes at runtime
- Use DataStore for simple preferences and state
- Use bundled resources/assets for static content
- Never store sensitive data (keys, passwords) in plain Room tables
- Always provide migrations for schema changes
