# Persistence

How the Meshtastic app stores data across different mechanisms.

## Room KMP Database

**Module:** `core:database`

The primary structured data store:
- Node information and history
- Message history
- Waypoints
- Telemetry data
- Channel configurations

### Key Points

- Uses Room KMP for cross-platform compatibility
- Migrations managed through Room's built-in migration system
- DAO interfaces live in `core:database`
- Repository layer in `core:repository` provides the public API
- Full-text message search is backed by an FTS5 content table (`PacketFts`) over `Packet`, kept in sync by Room-managed triggers

### What's Stored in Room

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `NodeEntity` | All known mesh nodes and their metadata |
| `MyNodeEntity` | The local node's own info |
| `Packet` | Message history (channel and direct), waypoints, and telemetry data |
| `PacketFts` | FTS5 virtual table mirroring `Packet.messageText` for full-text message search (Room-managed INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE triggers keep it in sync) |
| `ContactSettings` | Per-contact mute and read-state |
| `ReactionEntity` | Emoji reactions on messages |
| `MeshLog` | Raw mesh protocol logs |
| `MetadataEntity` | Device metadata (firmware version, hardware model) |
| `QuickChatAction` | User-configured quick-chat messages |
| `DeviceHardwareEntity` | Cached device hardware catalog |
| `FirmwareReleaseEntity` | Cached firmware release info |
| `TracerouteNodePositionEntity` | Traceroute hop position data |

> 💡 **Note:** Waypoints, telemetry, and channel data are stored within the `Packet` entity (using the `port_num` field to distinguish packet types) rather than in separate tables.

## DataStore Preferences

**Module:** `core:datastore`

For lightweight key-value preferences:
- Local radio configuration (LocalConfig proto)
- Module configuration (ModuleConfig proto)
- Channel set data
- Local statistics
- Recently connected device addresses

## Core Prefs

**Module:** `core:prefs`

Higher-level preferences abstraction:
- User-facing settings
- App behavior configuration
- Feature toggles

## What Docs Intentionally Skip

The `feature:docs` module uses **no** Room or persistent database. Documentation ships as build-time assets versioned with the app binary, so it stays fully offline, is replaced on each update, and needs no migration story. Optional UX state (e.g. last viewed page) could live in `core:prefs` but isn't part of the docs data model.

## Best Practices

- Use Room for structured, queryable data that changes at runtime
- Use DataStore for simple preferences and state
- Use bundled resources/assets for static content
- Never store sensitive data (keys, passwords) in plain Room tables
- Always provide migrations for schema changes
