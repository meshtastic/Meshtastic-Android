# Transport

Meshtastic communicates between the app and radio hardware through multiple transport mechanisms.

## Transport Abstraction

The transport layer is abstracted through interfaces defined in `core:repository` (`RadioTransport`, `RadioTransportFactory`, `RadioInterfaceService`), with the concrete transports implemented in `core:network` (`BleRadioTransport`, TCP, mock/replay) and `core:ble`. This lets the app work identically regardless of the underlying connection type.

```
App ← RadioController → Transport (BLE | Serial | TCP)
```

## Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

**Module:** `core:ble`  
**Platforms:** Android, Desktop (JVM via Kable), iOS (planned)

The primary transport for mobile devices and also available on desktop:
- Service discovery for Meshtastic GATT services
- Characteristic-based read/write for protobuf packets
- Connection state management and automatic reconnection
- MTU negotiation for optimal packet sizes

### Key Classes

- `core/ble/` — BLE scanning, connection, and GATT operations
- Platform-specific implementations in `androidMain` and `jvmMain` (Kable)

## USB Serial

**Module:** `core:network`  
**Platforms:** Android (OTG), Desktop

Serial communication over USB:
- Uses `usb-serial-for-android` library on Android
- Direct serial port access on Desktop (JVM)
- Probe table for supported USB vendor/product IDs
- Automatic detection when USB device is connected

### Key Classes

- Serial prober and transport factory in `core/network`
- Desktop-specific serial in `desktopApp/src/main/kotlin/.../radio/`

## TCP/IP

**Module:** `core:network`  
**Platforms:** Android, Desktop (iOS: code compiles, but there's no iOS app target or `RadioTransportFactory` yet — see Transport Factory below)

Network-based transport for WiFi-enabled radios:
- TCP socket connection to radio's IP address
- Default port: 4403
- Used for development with simulated radios
- Available when BLE/USB is impractical

## Transport Factory

The `RadioTransportFactory` interface abstracts transport creation:

```kotlin
interface RadioTransportFactory {
    val supportedDeviceTypes: List<DeviceType>
    fun createTransport(address: String, service: RadioInterfaceService): RadioTransport
    fun isMockTransport(): Boolean
    fun isAddressValid(address: String?): Boolean
    fun toInterfaceAddress(interfaceId: InterfaceId, rest: String): String
}
```

Platform-specific implementations:
- **Android:** Supports BLE + USB + TCP
- **Desktop:** Supports BLE (Kable) + USB + TCP
- **iOS:** Planned BLE + TCP

## Connection Lifecycle

1. **Discovery** — Scan for available radios (BLE scan / USB detect / manual TCP)
2. **Connection** — Establish link to selected radio
3. **Handshake** — Exchange node info and configuration
4. **Active** — Normal message exchange
5. **Disconnection** — Clean teardown or error recovery

## Adding a New Transport

1. Implement `RadioTransport` interface
2. Register in platform-specific `RadioTransportFactory`
3. Add connection UI in `feature:connections`
4. Update DI bindings for the platform
