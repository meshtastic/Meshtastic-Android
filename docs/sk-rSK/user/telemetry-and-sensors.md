# Telemetry & Sensors

Meshtastic nodes can collect and share sensor data across the mesh network.

## Overview

Telemetry allows nodes equipped with sensors to broadcast environmental, power, and device health information. This data is visible on the node detail screen and can be logged over time.

## Device Telemetry

All Meshtastic nodes report basic device telemetry:

| Metric             | Popis                          | Typical Range                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Battery Level      | Charge percentage              | 0–100%                                                             |

| Air Utilization TX | % of airtime used by this node | 0–100%                                                             |
| Doba prevádzky     | Seconds since last boot        | Varies                                                             |

### Air Quality

| Senzor   | Metric                                             | Notes                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| BME680   | Gas Resistance / IAQ                               | Volatile organic compounds |
| PMSA003I | PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10 | Particulate matter         |
| SEN55    | PM, NOx, VOC, Temp, Humidity                       | Multi-sensor               |

### Light & UV

| Senzor   | Metric                                 |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| OPT3001  | Ambient light (lux) |
| VEML7700 | Ambient light (lux) |
| LTR390   | UV index                               |

## Power Metrics

Nodes with INA-series power sensors can report:

| Metric      | Popis                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Bus Voltage | Supply rail voltage                       |
| Prúd        | Power consumption (mA) |
| Napájanie   | Calculated power (mW)  |

Useful for monitoring solar charging or battery health on remote nodes.

## Configuring Telemetry

1. Navigate to **Settings → Module Config → Telemetry**.
2. Set reporting intervals:
   - **Device Metrics Interval** — how often to broadcast device metrics
   - **Environment Metrics Interval** — how often to broadcast sensor data
3. Enable specific sensor types as needed.

### Recommended Intervals

| Use Case                                   | Device (s) | Environment (s) |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Urban mesh (many nodes) | 3600                          | 3600                               |
| Rural mesh (few nodes)  | 900                           | 900                                |
| Weather station                            | 900                           | 300                                |
| Battery conservation                       | 7200                          | 7200                               |

> ⚠️ **Note:** Shorter intervals increase airtime usage and battery drain across the mesh.

## Air Quality Metrics

Nodes with particulate matter or CO₂ sensors report air quality data:

| Metric                | Unit  | Popis                        |
| --------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------- |
| PM1.0 | µg/m³ | Ultrafine particulate matter |
| PM2.5 | µg/m³ | Fine particulate matter      |
| PM10                  | µg/m³ | Coarse particulate matter    |
| CO₂                   | ppm   | Carbon dioxide concentration |

CO₂ sensors such as the SCD4x also report their own temperature and humidity, which appear alongside the readings above. From PM2.5 history the app additionally derives an **EPA NowCast AQI** value.

The CO₂ reading is color-coded by severity (Good → Stuffy → Poor → Unsafe → Evacuate). See [Node Metrics — Air Quality](node-metrics#air-quality-metrics) for the exact ppm bands, colors, and AQI detail.

Air quality data can be viewed as info cards on the node detail screen, charted over time, and exported to CSV.

## Viewing Telemetry

1. Navigate to **Nodes** and select a node.
2. Telemetry sections show on the detail screen:
   - Device Metrics (always available)
   - Environment Metrics (if sensors present)
   - Power Metrics (if INA sensor present)
   - Air Quality Metrics (if PM/CO₂ sensor present)
3. Historical graphs show trends over time.

## Troubleshooting

- **No environment data showing?** The remote node needs a physical sensor connected (e.g., BME280 on I2C). Device telemetry (battery, uptime) is always available, but environment metrics require hardware.
- **Stale readings?** Check the reporting interval — very long intervals (7200s+) mean data updates infrequently. Also verify the remote node is still online.
- **Sensor conflict on I2C bus?** Some sensors share I2C addresses. If you have multiple sensors on the same bus, check for address collisions in the radio's serial debug output.
