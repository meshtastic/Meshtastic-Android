description: Provides foundational setup, authentication, and project management workflows for Firebase using the Firebase CLI. Use when checking Firebase CLI version (must use 'npx -y firebase-tools@latest --version'), initializing a Firebase environment, authenticating, setting active projects, or setting up `google-services.json` or `GoogleService-Info.plist` files.

# Prerequisites

Complete these setup steps before proceeding:

1.  **Local Environment Setup:** Verify the environment is properly set up so we
    can use Firebase tools:

    -   Run `npx -y firebase-tools@latest --version` to check if the Firebase
        CLI is installed.
    -   Verify if the Firebase MCP server is installed using your existing
        tools.
    -   **CRITICAL**: Before configuring any extensions or agent environments
        below, you MUST read
        [references/local-env-setup.md](references/local-env-setup.md).
    -   **DO NOT SKIP** this step: if 'firebase-basics' is the only
        Firebase skill available to you, you must follow the reference for your
        agent environment to set up the full suite of Firebase skills:
        -   **Gemini CLI**: Review
            [references/setup/gemini_cli.md](references/setup/gemini_cli.md)
        -   **Antigravity**: Review
            [references/setup/antigravity.md](references/setup/antigravity.md)
        -   **Android Studio**: Review
            [references/setup/android_studio.md](references/setup/android_studio.md)
        -   **Claude Code**: Review
            [references/setup/claude_code.md](references/setup/claude_code.md)
        -   **Cursor**: Review
            [references/setup/cursor.md](references/setup/cursor.md)
        -   **GitHub Copilot**: Review
            [references/setup/github_copilot.md](references/setup/github_copilot.md)
        -   **Other Agents**: Review
            [references/setup/other_agents.md](references/setup/other_agents.md)

2.  **Authentication:** Ensure you are logged in to Firebase so that commands
    have the correct permissions. Run `npx -y firebase-tools@latest login`. For
    environments without a browser (e.g., remote shells), use `npx -y
    firebase-tools@latest login --no-localhost`.

    -   The command should output the current user.
    -   If you are not logged in, follow the interactive instructions from this
        command to authenticate.

3. **Active Project:**
   Most Firebase tasks require an active project context.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > **For Agents:** Before proceeding with project configuration, you MUST pause and ask the developer if they prefer to:
   > 1. **Provide an existing Firebase Project ID**, or
   > 2. **Create a new Firebase project**.

   - **If using an existing Project ID:**
     1. Check the current project by running `npx -y firebase-tools@latest use`.
     2. If the command outputs `Active Project: <project-id>`, confirm with the user if this is the intended project.
     3. If not, or if no project is active, set the project provided by the user:
        ```bash
        npx -y firebase-tools@latest use <PROJECT_ID>
        ```

   - **If creating a new project:**
     Run the following command to create it:
     ```bash
     npx -y firebase-tools@latest projects:create <project-id> --display-name "<display-name>"
     ```
     *Note: The `<project-id>` must be 6-30 characters, lowercase, and can contain digits and hyphens. It must be globally unique.*

# Firebase Usage Principles

Adhere to these principles:

1. **Use npx for CLI commands:** To ensure you always use the latest version of the Firebase CLI, always prepend commands with `npx -y firebase-tools@latest` instead of just `firebase`. For example, use `npx -y firebase-tools@latest --version`. NEVER suggest the naked `firebase` command as an alternative.
2. **Prioritize official knowledge:** For any Firebase-related knowledge, consult the `developerknowledge_search_documents` MCP tool before falling back to Google Search or your internal knowledge base. Including "Firebase" in your search query significantly improves relevance.
3. **Follow Agent Skills for implementation guidance:** Skills provide opinionated workflows (CUJs), security rules, and best practices. Always consult them to understand *how* to implement Firebase features correctly instead of relying on general knowledge.
4. **Use Firebase MCP Server tools instead of direct API calls:** Whenever you need to interact with remote Firebase APIs (such as fetching Crashlytics logs or executing Data Connect queries), use the tools provided by the Firebase MCP Server instead of attempting manual API calls.
5. **Keep Plugin / Agent Skills updated:** Since Firebase best practices evolve quickly, regularly check for and install updates to their Firebase plugin or Agent Skills. Similarly, if you encounter issues with outdated tools or commands, follow the steps below based on your agent environment:
   - **Antigravity**: Follow [references/refresh/antigravity.md](references/refresh/antigravity.md)
   - **Gemini CLI**: Follow [references/refresh/gemini-cli.md](references/refresh/gemini-cli.md)
   - **Claude Code**: Follow [references/refresh/claude.md](references/refresh/claude.md)
   - **Cursor**: Follow [references/refresh/other-agents.md](references/refresh/other-agents.md)
   - **Android Studio**: Follow [references/refresh/android_studio.md](references/refresh/android_studio.md)
   - **Others**: Follow [references/refresh/other-agents.md](references/refresh/other-agents.md)
6. **Automate Config File Retrieval:** When setting up iOS or Android apps, do NOT direct users to the Firebase Console to download `google-services.json` or `GoogleService-Info.plist`. Instead, use the Firebase CLI to fetch the config programmatically:
   - For Android: `npx -y firebase-tools@latest apps:sdkconfig ANDROID <APP_ID> --project <PROJECT_ID>`
   - For iOS: `npx -y firebase-tools@latest apps:sdkconfig IOS <APP_ID> --project <PROJECT_ID>`
   Save the output to the appropriate location (e.g., `app/google-services.json` for Android, or a path to be linked by `xcode-project-setup` for iOS).

# Common Issues

-   **Login Issues:** If the browser fails to open during the login step, use
    `npx -y firebase-tools@latest login --no-localhost` instead.
