# Initialization

Before initializing, check if you are already in a Firebase project directory by looking for `firebase.json`.

1. **Project Directory:**
   Navigate to the root directory of the codebase. 
   *(Only if starting a completely new project from scratch without an existing codebase, create a directory first: `mkdir my-project && cd my-project`)*

2. **Initialize Services:**
   Run the initialization command:
   ```bash
   npx -y firebase-tools@latest init
   ```

The CLI will guide you through:
- Selecting features (Firestore, Functions, Hosting, etc.).
- Associating with an existing project or creating a new one.
- Configuring files (e.g. `firebase.json`, `.firebaserc`).
