# GitHub Copilot Setup

To get the most out of Firebase with GitHub Copilot in VS Code, follow these steps to install the agent skills and the MCP server.

## Recommended: Global Setup

The agent skills and MCP server should be installed globally for consistent access across projects.

### 1. Install and Verify Firebase Skills
Check if the skills are already installed before proceeding:

1. **Check Local skills**: Run `npx skills list --agent github-copilot`. If the output includes `firebase-basics`, the skills are already installed locally.
2. **Check Global skills**: If not found locally, check the global installation by running:
   ```bash
   npx skills list --global --agent github-copilot
   ```
   If the output includes `firebase-basics`, the skills are already installed globally.
3. **Install Skills**: If both checks fail, run the following command to install the Firebase agent skills:
   ```bash
   npx skills add firebase/agent-skills --agent github-copilot --skill "*"
   ```
   *Note: Omit `--yes` and `--global` to choose the installation location manually. If prompted interactively in the terminal, ensure you send the appropriate user choices via standard input to complete the installation.*
4. **Verify Installation**: Re-run the checks in steps 1 or 2 to confirm that `firebase-basics` is now available.

### 2. Configure and Verify Firebase MCP Server
The MCP server allows GitHub Copilot to interact directly with Firebase projects.

1. **Locate `mcp.json`**: Find the configuration file for your environment:
   - Workspace: `.vscode/mcp.json`
   - Global: User Settings `mcp.json` file.
   
   *Note: If the `.vscode/` directory or `mcp.json` file does not exist, create them and initialize the file with `{ "mcp": { "servers": {} } }` before proceeding.*
2. **Check Existing Configuration**: Open the `mcp.json` file and check the `mcp.servers` object for a `firebase` entry.
   - It is already configured if the `command` is `"firebase"` OR if the `command` is `"npx"` with `"firebase-tools"` and `"mcp"` in the `args`.
   - **Important**: If a valid `firebase` entry is found, the MCP server is already configured. **Skip step 3** and proceed directly to step 4.
   
   **Example valid configurations**:
   ```json
   "firebase": {
     "type": "stdio",
     "command": "npx",
     "args": ["-y", "firebase-tools@latest", "mcp"]
   }
   ```
   OR
   ```json
   "firebase": {
     "type": "stdio",
     "command": "firebase",
     "args": ["mcp"]
   }
   ```
3. **Add or Update Configuration**: If the `firebase` block is missing or incorrect, add it to the `mcp.servers` object:
   ```json
   "firebase": {
     "type": "stdio",
     "command": "npx",
     "args": [
       "-y",
       "firebase-tools@latest",
       "mcp"
     ]
   }
   ```
   *CRITICAL: Merge this configuration into the existing `mcp.json` file under the `mcp.servers` object. You MUST preserve any other existing servers inside `mcp.servers`.*
4. **Verify Configuration**: Save the file and confirm the `firebase` block is present and properly formatted JSON.

### 3. Restart and Verify Connection
1. **Restart VS Code**: Instruct the user to restart VS Code. **Stop and wait** for their confirmation before proceeding.
2. **Confirm Connection**: Check the MCP server list in the VS Code Copilot UI to confirm that the Firebase MCP server is connected.
