# Claude Code Setup

To get the most out of Firebase in Claude Code, follow these steps to install the agent skills and the MCP server.

## Recommended Method: Using Plugins

The recommended method is using the plugin marketplace to install both the agent skills and the MCP functionality.

### 1. Install and Verify Plugins

Check if the plugins are already installed before proceeding:

1. **Check Existing Skills**: Run `npx skills list --agent claude-code` to check for local skills. Run `npx skills list --global --agent claude-code` to check for global skills. Note whether the output includes `firebase-basics`.
2. **Check Existing MCP Configuration**: Run `claude mcp list -s user` and `claude mcp list -s project`. Note whether the output of either command includes `firebase`.
3. **Determine Installation Path**:
   - If **both** skills and MCP configuration are found, the plugin is fully installed. **Stop here and skip all remaining setup steps in this document.**
   - If **neither** are found, proceed to step 4.
   - If **only one** is found (e.g., skills are installed but MCP is missing, or vice versa), **stop and prompt the user**. Explain the mixed state and ask if they want to proceed with installing the Firebase plugin before continuing to step 4.
4. **Add Marketplace**: Run the following command to add the marketplace (this uses the default User scope):
   ```bash
   claude plugin marketplace add firebase/agent-skills
   ```
5. **Install Plugins**: Run the following command to install the plugin:
   ```bash
   claude plugin install firebase@firebase
   ```
6. **Verify Installation**: Re-run the checks in steps 1 and 2 to confirm the skills and the MCP server are now available.

### 2. Restart and Verify Connection
1. **Restart Claude Code**: Instruct the user to restart Claude Code. **Stop and wait** for their confirmation before proceeding.
