# Flutter & Firebase Setup Guide

This guide covers the initial setup of Flutter and its integration with Firebase using the FlutterFire CLI.

## Prerequisites

1. **Flutter SDK**: Ensure Flutter is installed and available in the PATH.
   
   **Standard Setup (Manual):**
   1. **Determine Architecture**: Check if you are on Intel (`x64`) or Apple Silicon (`arm64`) using `uname -m`.
   2. **Download SDK**: Fetch the latest stable SDK from the [Flutter Archive](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/archive?tab=macos).
   3. **Extract**: Unzip the SDK to a permanent directory (e.g., `~/development/flutter`).
   4. **Update PATH**: Add the `bin` folder to your shell configuration (e.g., `~/.zshrc`).
      ```bash
      echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/development/flutter/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc
      source ~/.zshrc
      ```
   5. **Verify**: Run `flutter doctor` to ensure the SDK is correctly linked and initialized.

2. **Firebase CLI**: Ensure the Firebase CLI is available.
   - Run `npx -y firebase-tools@latest --version`.
   - Login with `npx -y firebase-tools@latest login`.

3. **FlutterFire CLI**: Install the official FlutterFire CLI globally.
   - Run `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`.
   - **Note**: Ensure `~/.pub-cache/bin` is also in your PATH if `flutterfire` is not found.

## Step 1: Create a Flutter Project
If you don't have a project yet, create one:
```bash
flutter create my_awesome_app
cd my_awesome_app
```

## Step 2: Configure Firebase
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **For Agents:** Before running the configuration command, you MUST pause and ask the developer if they prefer to:
> 1. Create a new Firebase project, or
> 2. Provide an existing Firebase Project ID.

- If the developer provides an existing Project ID, run:
  ```bash
  flutterfire configure --project=<project_id>
  ```
- If the developer prefers to create a new project interactively, run:
  ```bash
  flutterfire configure
  ```

This tool automates:
- Registering your apps (iOS, Android, Web, etc.) with a Firebase project.
- Generating the `lib/firebase_options.dart` file.


## Step 3: Initialize Firebase in Code
Add the `firebase_core` package and initialize it in your `main.dart`.

1. Add the dependency:
```bash
flutter pub add firebase_core
```

2. Update `lib/main.dart`:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'firebase_options.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp(
    options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
  );
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Add Firebase Services
To add specific services (Firestore, Auth, etc.), follow the "Pub Add & Configure" pattern:

1. Add the service: `flutter pub add cloud_firestore`
2. **Crucial**: Re-run `flutterfire configure` to sync platform configurations.
3. Import and use the package in your code.

## Step 5: Important Gotchas & Platform Specifics

### 1. Re-running `flutterfire configure` Upon Renaming
When creating a new project, developers often change the bundle identifier (iOS) or `applicationId` (Android) after the fact. If the package names change, `flutterfire configure` **must** be re-run to update the respective Google service files and `firebase_options.dart`.

### 2. Platform-Specific Build Requirements
- **Android**: Adding Firebase often requires a higher `minSdkVersion` (commonly `21` or `23`) than the platform default. Be prepared to update `android/app/build.gradle` automatically when installing certain plugins.
- **iOS**: Always check if there is a `Podfile` in the `/ios` directory whenever native services (like `cloud_firestore`) are added. If there is, run `pod install`. Failing to do this will cause Xcode build errors. Note that Flutter is moving towards Swift Package Manager (SPM), and FlutterFire supports SPM, so a `Podfile` may not exist if the project only uses SPM dependencies.

### 3. Web CORS Best Practices
When testing Firebase features locally on Chrome, requests to Google servers can sometimes get blocked by CORS policies. Avoid relying on `--disable-web-security` flags as it promotes bad security practices. Instead, run the app on localhost with a specific port, and ensure `localhost` is added to your Firebase Auth "Authorized Domains".
  ```bash
  flutter run -d chrome --web-hostname=localhost --web-port=5000
  ```

### 4. Elaborating on `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`
In your `main.dart`, this call is mandatory before `Firebase.initializeApp()`. 
*Why?* Because Firebase initialization requires communication across Flutter's native iOS/Android method channels. `ensureInitialized()` guarantees the Fluter engine is fully booted up and ready to handle these native platform calls before `runApp()` executes.
