# Refresh Other Local Environment

Follow these steps to refresh the local environment of other agents, ensuring that their agent skills and plugins are fully up-to-date.

Other agents rely on `npx skills`. Updates should prioritize the global level; if skills are installed at the project level, omit the `--global` flag.

Replace `<AGENT_NAME>` with the actual agent name, which can be found in the [skills repository README](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills/blob/main/README.md).

1. **List Available Skills:** Identify all Firebase skills available in the repository:
   ```bash
   npx -y skills add firebase/agent-skills --list
   ```

2. **Check Currently Installed Skills:** Determine which skills are already installed and linked for the agent at both project and global levels:
   ```bash
   # Check project-level skills
   npx -y skills list --agent <AGENT_NAME>

   # Check global-level skills
   npx -y skills list --agent <AGENT_NAME> --global
   ```
   *Note: If a skill shows `Agents: not linked` in the output, it is installed but not currently available to the agent.*

3. **Add Missing or Unlinked Skills:** Compare the results from Step 1 and Step 2. For each missing or unlinked skill, follow the appropriate conditional instruction below:

   - **IF any Firebase skills were found at the PROJECT level in Step 2:** Add the missing skill to the project level:
     ```bash
     npx -y skills add firebase/agent-skills --agent <AGENT_NAME> --skill "<SKILL_NAME>" --yes
     ```

   - **IF any Firebase skills were found at the GLOBAL level in Step 2:** Add the missing skill to the global level:
     ```bash
     npx -y skills add firebase/agent-skills --agent <AGENT_NAME> --skill "<SKILL_NAME>" --global --yes
     ```

   - **IF NO Firebase skills were found in Step 2:** Add each missing skill to the global level:
     ```bash
     npx -y skills add firebase/agent-skills --agent <AGENT_NAME> --skill "<SKILL_NAME>" --global --yes
     ```

4. **Update Existing Skills:** Update all currently installed skills to their latest versions:
   ```bash
   # Update project-level skills
   npx -y skills update --agent <AGENT_NAME> --yes

   # Update global-level skills
   npx -y skills update --agent <AGENT_NAME> --global --yes
   ```
