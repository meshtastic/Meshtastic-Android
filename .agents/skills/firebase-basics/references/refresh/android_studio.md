# Refresh Android Studio Local Environment

Follow these steps to refresh Gemini in Android Studio's local environment, ensuring that agent skills are fully up-to-date.

Gemini in Android Studio expects skills to be located at `~/.agents/skills`.

1. **List Available Skills:** Identify all Firebase skills available in the repository:
   ```bash
   npx -y skills add firebase/agent-skills --list
   ```

2. **Check Currently Installed Skills:** Check the contents of the skills directory to see what is currently installed:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.agents/skills
   ```

3. **Add Missing Skills:** Use the `skills` CLI to add skills. If the CLI supports an `android_studio` agent identifier, you can run:
   ```bash
   npx -y skills add firebase/agent-skills --agent android_studio --skill "*" --yes
   ```
   If the `skills` CLI does not support Android Studio directly, you can manually copy or symlink the desired skills from your local clone of `firebase/agent-skills` to `~/.agents/skills`.

4. **Update Existing Skills:** To update skills, you can try:
   ```bash
   npx -y skills update --agent android_studio --yes
   ```
   If manual installation was used, pull the latest changes from the `firebase/agent-skills` repository and copy the updated files to `~/.agents/skills`.
