## Location Sharing Feature

### Overview
Added a location sharing button (üìç) to the QuickChat menu that allows users to share their current GPS coordinates as a clickable Google Maps link in conversations.

### User Story
When a user taps the üìç pin icon in the QuickChat menu, their current GPS coordinates (from the connected Meshtastic node) are inserted into the message as a markdown-formatted link. The displayed text shows coordinates with 4 decimal places for readability, while the embedded URL contains 7 decimal places for precise navigation.

### Implementation Journey

#### Initial Requirements
- Add a tappable map pin icon to the messaging interface
- Insert GPS coordinates as a Google Maps link when tapped
- Use coordinates from the Meshtastic node's GPS (not the phone's GPS)
- Display the link in a clean, user-friendly format

#### Iteration 1: Direct Button Approach (Failed)
**Attempt**: Added a location `IconButton` directly above the `MessageInput` TextField.

**Result**: Button was not visible in the UI.

**Reason for Failure**: The button placement conflicted with the existing UI layout and wasn't integrated with the established message input patterns.

**Lesson Learned**: Need to follow existing UI patterns rather than creating new UI elements.

#### Iteration 2: QuickChat Integration (Partially Successful)
**Attempt**: Added location pin to `QuickChatRow` alongside the bell icon (üîî) using the `QuickChatAction` system.

**Implementation**:
- Created a `QuickChatAction` with:
  - `name = "üìç"`
  - `message = "https://maps.google.com/?q={lat},{lon}"`
  - `mode = QuickChatAction.Mode.Append`
  - `position = -2` (special position for built-in actions)

**Result**: App crashed on opening conversation.

**Error**:
```
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Key "0" was already used
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- The `QuickChatAction` data class has a default `uuid = 0L`
- Both the bell action and location action had `uuid = 0L`
- LazyRow was using `key = { it.uuid }`, causing duplicate key conflict
- The issue occurred because both special actions (bell and location) were dynamically created with the same default UUID

**Fix**: Changed LazyRow key from `it.uuid` to `it.position`:
```kotlin
items(allActions, key = { it.position }) { action ->
```

**Files Modified**:
- `feature/messaging/src/main/kotlin/org/meshtastic/feature/messaging/Message.kt:key = { it.position }`

#### Iteration 3: Smart Cast Issue
**Problem**: Kotlin compilation error:
```
Smart cast to 'Node' is impossible, because 'ourNode' is a property that has open or custom getter
```

**Root Cause**: `ourNode` is a delegated property created with `by collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`, which Kotlin cannot smart cast due to its dynamic nature.

**Fix**: Changed from nullable check to `takeIf`:
```kotlin
// Before (didn't compile):
ourNode?.validPosition?.let { ourNode.latitude }

// After (works):
ourNode?.takeIf { it.validPosition != null }?.latitude
```

#### Iteration 4: Coordinate Precision Consistency
**Problem**: GPS coordinates varied from 7-15 decimal places in the displayed link.

**Root Cause**:
- GPS coordinates are stored as integers in the Meshtastic protocol
- They're multiplied by 1e-7 to convert to degrees
- Kotlin's `Double.toString()` drops trailing zeros
- Example: 37.7749000 becomes "37.7749", but 37.7749295 stays "37.7749295"

**Fix**: Applied consistent formatting:
```kotlin
val formattedLat = "%.7f".format(userLatitude)
val formattedLon = "%.7f".format(userLongitude)
```

**Precision Rationale**:
- 7 decimal places = ~1.1 cm precision (sufficient for GPS accuracy)
- Consistent with Meshtastic protocol's 1e-7 multiplier

#### Iteration 5: Markdown Link Support
**Problem**: User wanted displayed coordinates to be shorter (4 decimals) but URL to maintain full precision (7 decimals).

**Challenge**: Standard auto-linkification doesn't support different display text vs. URL.

**Solution**: Implemented markdown link syntax `[display](url)` support in `AutoLinkText` component.

**Implementation**:

1. **Added `processMarkdownAndLinks()` function** to parse markdown before auto-linkification:
```kotlin
private fun processMarkdownAndLinks(text: String, linkStyles: TextLinkStyles): AnnotatedString {
    val markdownLinks = mutableListOf<MarkdownLink>()
    val markdownPattern = "\\[([^\\]]+)\\]\\(([^)]+)\\)".toRegex()
    var processedText = text
    var offsetAdjustment = 0

    // Extract markdown links
    markdownPattern.findAll(text).forEach { match ->
        val displayText = match.groupValues[1]
        val url = match.groupValues[2]
        val originalStart = match.range.first - offsetAdjustment
        markdownLinks.add(
            MarkdownLink(
                start = originalStart,
                end = originalStart + displayText.length,
                displayText = displayText,
                url = url
            )
        )
        // Replace [text](url) with just text for linkify processing
        processedText = processedText.replaceFirst(match.value, displayText)
        offsetAdjustment += match.value.length - displayText.length
    }

    // Linkify remaining URLs
    val spannable = linkify(processedText)

    // Combine markdown and auto-detected links
    return spannable.toAnnotatedStringWithMarkdown(linkStyles, markdownLinks)
}
```

2. **Updated location action** to use markdown format:
```kotlin
val displayLat = "%.4f".format(userLatitude)
val displayLon = "%.4f".format(userLongitude)
val urlLat = "%.7f".format(userLatitude)
val urlLon = "%.7f".format(userLongitude)

QuickChatAction(
    name = "üìç",
    message = "[$displayLat,$displayLon](https://maps.google.com/?q=$urlLat,$urlLon)",
    mode = QuickChatAction.Mode.Append,
    position = -2,
)
```

**Result**:
- Unsent message shows raw markdown: `[37.7749,-122.4194](https://maps.google.com/?q=37.7749295,-122.4194155)`
- Sent message displays clean link: `37.7749,-122.4194` (clickable)
- Click opens Google Maps with full precision coordinates

**Files Modified**:
- `core/ui/src/main/kotlin/org/meshtastic/core/ui/component/AutoLinkText.kt`: Added markdown parsing
- `feature/messaging/src/main/kotlin/org/meshtastic/feature/messaging/Message.kt`: Updated location action

#### Iteration 6: Conversation Preview Cleanup
**Problem**: Conversation list showed full markdown syntax instead of just the shortened coordinates.

**Example**:
```
Conversation Preview:
[37.7749,-122.4194](https://maps.google.com/?q=37.7749295,-122.4194155)
```

**Expected**:
```
Conversation Preview:
37.7749,-122.4194
```

**Root Cause**: The conversation preview text (`lastMessageText`) wasn't processing markdown - it was just showing the raw message text.

**Solution**: Added `stripMarkdownLinks()` function to `ContactsViewModel.kt`:

```kotlin
/**
 * Strips markdown link syntax [text](url) from a string, keeping only the display text.
 * This is used for message previews to show clean text instead of raw markdown.
 */
private fun stripMarkdownLinks(text: String?): String? {
    return text?.replace("\\[([^\\]]+)\\]\\([^)]+\\)".toRegex(), "$1")
}

// Applied to preview text:
Contact(
    lastMessageText = stripMarkdownLinks(
        if (fromLocal) data.text else "$shortName: ${data.text}"
    ),
    // ...
)
```

**Files Modified**:
- `app/src/main/java/com/geeksville/mesh/ui/contact/ContactsViewModel.kt`: Added markdown stripping for previews

### Final Implementation

#### Files Modified

1. **core/ui/src/main/kotlin/org/meshtastic/core/ui/component/AutoLinkText.kt**
   - Added markdown link parsing functionality
   - Supports `[display](url)` syntax
   - Maintains backward compatibility with auto-linkification

2. **feature/messaging/src/main/kotlin/org/meshtastic/feature/messaging/Message.kt**
   - Added `userLatitude` and `userLongitude` parameters to `QuickChatRow`
   - Created dynamic location `QuickChatAction` with position=-2
   - Formats coordinates: 4 decimals for display, 7 for URL
   - Changed LazyRow key to `it.position` to avoid UUID conflicts

3. **app/src/main/java/com/geeksville/mesh/ui/contact/ContactsViewModel.kt**
   - Added `stripMarkdownLinks()` function for conversation previews
   - Applied to `lastMessageText` to show clean text

#### Architecture Decisions

**Why QuickChat instead of dedicated button?**
- Consistent with existing UI patterns
- Users already familiar with QuickChat for inserting pre-defined content
- Leverages existing `QuickChatAction` infrastructure
- Appears alongside other communication shortcuts (bell icon)

**Why markdown links?**
- Allows different display precision vs. URL precision
- Clean visual presentation in sent messages
- Standard, well-understood format
- Easy to strip for previews

**Why position-based LazyRow keys?**
- Positions are guaranteed unique for special actions (negative) and user actions (positive)
- More stable than UUIDs which default to 0L for dynamically created actions
- Prevents duplicate key crashes

**Why 4 vs 7 decimal places?**
- 4 decimals = ~11 meters precision (readable, not overwhelming)
- 7 decimals = ~1.1 cm precision (maximum GPS accuracy)
- Display optimizes for readability, URL optimizes for precision

### Testing Notes

**Tested Scenarios**:
1. ‚úÖ Tapping location pin inserts coordinates
2. ‚úÖ Coordinates display with 4 decimals in unsent message
3. ‚úÖ After sending, message shows clean clickable link
4. ‚úÖ Clicking link opens Google Maps with precise coordinates
5. ‚úÖ Conversation preview shows shortened coordinates only
6. ‚úÖ Works when node has valid GPS position
7. ‚úÖ Location pin hidden when node lacks GPS position
8. ‚úÖ No crashes with multiple special QuickChat actions

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- Node without GPS: Location action not created (`takeIf { it.validPosition != null }`)
- Multiple actions with same UUID: Fixed with position-based keys
- Smart cast issues: Resolved with `takeIf` pattern
- Preview text showing markdown: Stripped with regex replacement

## BLE Reconnection Fix

### Overview
Fixed a critical bug where the app would fail to reconnect to the Meshtastic node via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) after a connection drop, requiring users to toggle Android's BLE settings to recover.

### User Story
Users experienced connection failures when the BLE connection to their Meshtastic node was interrupted. After disconnection, attempts to reconnect would fail with a warning message, and the only workaround was to disable and re-enable Bluetooth in Android settings.

### Problem Discovery

#### Initial Report
User reported: "This app was able to connect to BLE on node for a while, and then started failing to connect. Repeated attempts continue to fail. Disabling and re-enabling the BLE device in Android resolves the issue."

#### Log Analysis Process

**Step 1: Locate Error Pattern**
- Examined large logcat file (2MB, ~172,000 lines)
- Searched from end of file backward (recent events)
- Found suspicious warning at line 171861, timestamp 21:37:10.779:

```
W RadioInterfaceService: Ignoring setBondedDevice ...:E4, because we are already using that device
D MeshService: SetDeviceAddress: Device address is unchanged, ignoring.
```

**Step 2: Trace GATT Connection History**
Reconstructed connection timeline from GATT callbacks:

```
21:19:36.956 - Connected (state=2)
21:19:58.987 - Disconnected (state=0, status=8, "Lost connection")
21:25:56.190 - Reconnected (state=2)
21:26:47.226 - Disconnected (state=0, status=19)
21:34:23.885 - Reconnected (state=2)
21:34:53.xxx - [Connection lost - no explicit disconnect logged]
21:37:10.779 - Connection attempt REFUSED: "Ignoring setBondedDevice"
```

**Key Observation**: Multiple successful reconnections followed by eventual failure. The pattern showed the app could reconnect initially but eventually entered a state where it refused new connections.

**Step 3: Analyze Service State Management**

Searched for the warning message in source code:
```bash
$ grep -r "Ignoring setBondedDevice" --include="*.kt"
```

Found in `RadioInterfaceService.kt:319`:
```kotlin
private fun setBondedDeviceAddress(address: String?): Boolean =
    if (getBondedDeviceAddress() == address && isStarted) {
        Timber.w("Ignoring setBondedDevice ${address.anonymize}, because we are already using that device")
        false
    } else {
        // ... proceed with connection
    }
```

### Root Cause Analysis

#### The Bug
The `setBondedDeviceAddress()` function checks if it should allow a new connection by verifying:
1. Is the device address the same? (`getBondedDeviceAddress() == address`)
2. Is the interface started? (`isStarted`)

**Critical Flaw**: The check doesn't verify if the device is **actually connected**.

#### State Management Flow

**Normal Connection Flow**:
1. User selects device ‚Üí `setDeviceAddress()` called
2. `setBondedDeviceAddress()` checks: address != current OR not started ‚Üí Proceed
3. `startInterface()` sets `isStarted = true`
4. BluetoothInterface connects via GATT
5. `onConnect()` called ‚Üí `_connectionState = CONNECTED`

**Connection Loss Flow**:
1. GATT connection drops (device sleep, out of range, etc.)
2. BluetoothInterface detects via `lostConnectCb` callback
3. Calls `scheduleReconnect("connection dropped")`
4. Eventually calls `service.onDisconnect(false)`
5. `onDisconnect()` updates `_connectionState = DEVICE_SLEEP`
6. **BUT**: `isStarted` remains `true` ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Reconnection Attempt Flow**:
1. User tries to reconnect ‚Üí `setDeviceAddress()` called
2. `setBondedDeviceAddress()` checks:
   - Same address? ‚úÖ Yes
   - `isStarted`? ‚úÖ Yes (still true from previous connection)
3. **Result**: "Ignoring setBondedDevice" ‚Üí Refuses connection
4. User stuck in disconnected state

**Why BLE Toggle Fixes It**:
When user toggles BLE off/on:
1. Android forcefully disconnects all BLE connections
2. App receives BLE state change ‚Üí `bluetoothRepository.state.enabled = false`
3. Triggers `stopInterface()` in `RadioInterfaceService`
4. `stopInterface()` sets `isStarted = false`
5. Next connection attempt passes the check

### The Fix

#### Solution Design
Instead of only checking `isStarted`, also verify the actual connection state:

```kotlin
private fun setBondedDeviceAddress(address: String?): Boolean =
    if (getBondedDeviceAddress() == address &&
        isStarted &&
        _connectionState.value == ConnectionState.CONNECTED) {  // ‚Üê Added this check
        Timber.w("Ignoring setBondedDevice ${address.anonymize}, because we are already using that device")
        false
    } else {
        // ... proceed with connection
    }
```

#### Why This Works

**Three-way Check**:
1. **Same address**: Prevents switching to wrong device
2. **`isStarted`**: Interface infrastructure is running
3. **`_connectionState == CONNECTED`**: **Actually connected via GATT**

**Connection States** (from `ConnectionState` enum):
- `CONNECTED`: Active GATT connection established
- `DEVICE_SLEEP`: Was connected, device went to sleep
- `DISCONNECTED`: No connection, interface stopped

**New Behavior**:
- CONNECTED state ‚Üí Refuse duplicate connection (correct)
- DEVICE_SLEEP state ‚Üí Allow reconnection (fixes the bug)
- DISCONNECTED state ‚Üí Allow reconnection (correct)

### Implementation Details

#### File Modified
**`app/src/main/java/com/geeksville/mesh/repository/radio/RadioInterfaceService.kt`**

Line 318:
```kotlin
// Before:
if (getBondedDeviceAddress() == address && isStarted) {

// After:
if (getBondedDeviceAddress() == address && isStarted && _connectionState.value == ConnectionState.CONNECTED) {
```

#### Related Code Sections

**Connection State Updates**:
```kotlin
// RadioInterfaceService.kt:243
fun onConnect() {
    if (_connectionState.value != ConnectionState.CONNECTED) {
        broadcastConnectionChanged(ConnectionState.CONNECTED)
    }
}

// RadioInterfaceService.kt:249
fun onDisconnect(isPermanent: Boolean) {
    val newTargetState = if (isPermanent) ConnectionState.DISCONNECTED else ConnectionState.DEVICE_SLEEP
    if (_connectionState.value != newTargetState) {
        broadcastConnectionChanged(newTargetState)
    }
}
```

**BluetoothInterface Callbacks**:
```kotlin
// BluetoothInterface.kt:533
safe!!.asyncConnect(
    true,
    cb = ::onConnect,
    lostConnectCb = { scheduleReconnect("connection dropped") }
)

// BluetoothInterface.kt:381
reconnectJob = service.serviceScope.handledLaunch {
    retryDueToException()
}

private suspend fun retryDueToException() {
    // ...
    service.onDisconnect(false) // Sets DEVICE_SLEEP, not DISCONNECTED
    delay(backoffMillis)
    // ...
}
```

### Testing Strategy

**Test Cases**:
1. ‚úÖ Normal connection attempt when disconnected ‚Üí Should connect
2. ‚úÖ Duplicate connection attempt when already connected ‚Üí Should refuse (warning)
3. ‚úÖ Reconnection after connection drop ‚Üí Should connect (bug fix)
4. ‚úÖ Reconnection after device sleep ‚Üí Should connect (bug fix)
5. ‚úÖ Connection to different device ‚Üí Should disconnect old, connect new

**Expected Logcat Patterns**:

**Before Fix**:
```
D RadioInterfaceService: SetDeviceAddress: ...
W RadioInterfaceService: Ignoring setBondedDevice ...:E4, because we are already using that device
D MeshService: SetDeviceAddress: Device address is unchanged, ignoring.
[No reconnection happens]
```

**After Fix**:
```
D RadioInterfaceService: SetDeviceAddress: ...
D RadioInterfaceService: Setting bonded device to ...
I RadioInterfaceService: Starting radio ...
I BluetoothInterface: Creating radio interface service
[Connection proceeds normally]
```

### Architecture Impact

#### Minimal Change Philosophy
- Changed only one condition in one function
- No new state variables introduced
- Leverages existing `_connectionState` already tracked by service
- No changes to connection/disconnection callbacks
- No changes to BluetoothInterface

#### Why This Approach?
1. **Correctness**: Uses actual GATT state instead of inferred state
2. **Simplicity**: Single-line change minimizes regression risk
3. **Maintainability**: Obvious intent ("only refuse if truly connected")
4. **Testability**: Easy to verify with state assertions

### Related Components

**RadioInterfaceService** (`app/.../repository/radio/RadioInterfaceService.kt`):
- Central service managing radio interface lifecycle
- Maintains `_connectionState` StateFlow
- Controls interface start/stop
- Handles device address changes

**BluetoothInterface** (`app/.../repository/radio/BluetoothInterface.kt`):
- Implements BLE GATT communication
- Manages connection lifecycle
- Handles reconnection attempts with exponential backoff
- Calls `onConnect()` and `onDisconnect()` callbacks

**ConnectionState** enum:
- `DISCONNECTED`: No active connection
- `DEVICE_SLEEP`: Connection lost temporarily (device sleeping)
- `CONNECTED`: Active GATT connection established

### Lessons Learned

1. **State Management**: Boolean flags (`isStarted`) can become stale; prefer using actual state enums (`ConnectionState`)

2. **Log Analysis**: Connection issues require reconstructing timeline from GATT callbacks, not just looking at errors

3. **Minimal Fixes**: Sometimes the best fix is adding one condition rather than refactoring state management

4. **User Workarounds**: When users find workarounds (BLE toggle), it reveals which state needs resetting

5. **Testing Reconnection**: Connection bugs often only appear after connection drops, not on initial connect

### Future Improvements

**Potential Enhancements** (not implemented):
1. Add connection health monitoring (timeout-based state verification)
2. Implement automatic reconnection when DEVICE_SLEEP detected
3. Add telemetry for connection state transitions
4. Surface connection state to UI for user visibility
5. Add exponential backoff for manual reconnection attempts

**Why Not Implemented Now**:
- Current fix resolves user-reported issue completely
- Additional features increase complexity and testing surface
- Better to validate minimal fix before adding features
- User can manually retry if automatic retry isn't desired

```

### Feature: BLE Reconnection Fix
**Branch**: `feature/ble-reconnection-fix`

**Commit Message**:
```
fix: Allow BLE reconnection after connection drop

Fixes bug where app refused to reconnect to Meshtastic node after
BLE connection loss, requiring Android BLE toggle to recover.

Root Cause:
RadioInterfaceService.setBondedDeviceAddress() only checked isStarted
flag, which remained true even after GATT disconnection. This caused
the service to refuse reconnection attempts thinking it was still
connected.

Solution:
Add connection state check to setBondedDeviceAddress() condition:
- Only refuse connection if ACTUALLY connected (CONNECTED state)
- Allow reconnection if DEVICE_SLEEP or DISCONNECTED

Impact:
Users can now reconnect after connection drops without toggling BLE.

Technical Details:
- Changed condition from: isStarted
- To: isStarted && _connectionState.value == ConnectionState.CONNECTED
- Uses existing ConnectionState enum (CONNECTED/DEVICE_SLEEP/DISCONNECTED)
- No new state variables, minimal change for correctness

Files Modified:
- app/src/main/java/com/geeksville/mesh/repository/radio/RadioInterfaceService.kt:318
```
