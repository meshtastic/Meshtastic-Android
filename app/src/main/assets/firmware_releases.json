        "release_notes": "> [!IMPORTANT]  \r\n> When we initially released the 2.5 version of the firmware, [we added a new bit `OkToMqtt` to packets to express the intent of users to opt-in to their packets being uplinked to an MQTT broker](https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/radio/lora/#ok-to-mqtt\r\n). \r\n>\r\n>Prior to this, uplinking of packets was just implicit fact, which was not fair to users wishing to remain off of any public brokers, maps, etc. However, in order to not immediately begin dumping all of the traffic from previous firmware versions from going to MQTT, we allowed for a grace period to transition folks to the newer 2.5.X firmware, where they can now opt-in, or remain off (by default). This grace period has concluded. The firmware will now enforce that the `OkToMqtt` bit is both present and opted into before uplinking any packets to MQTT. \r\n\r\n## üöÄ Enhancements \r\n* Minimize time between channel scan and actual transmit by @GUVWAF in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5383\r\n* Allows all 3 PKI keys to be added to userPrefs.h (#4969) and a tool. by @gjelsoe in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5368\r\n* Check for OkToMqtt flag presence before uplinking to MQTT by @thebentern in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5413\r\n* Telemetry can respond to want-response for LocalStats variant by @thebentern in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5414\r\n* Add canned message and keyboard in indicator board by @Dylanliacc in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5410\r\n* Add smiley emoji by @jcyrio in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5391\r\n* Enable trace route function on rak wismeshtap platform by @DanielCao0 in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5389\r\n* Add GPS in indicator board by @Dylanliacc in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5411\r\n* /api/v1/fromradio: add OPTIONS handler for CORS. by @cpatulea in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5386\r\n* Create a specific hw_model for WisMesh Tap by @thebentern in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5400\r\n\r\n## üêõ Bug fixes and maintenance\r\n* Make heart emoji usable by @jcyrio in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5403\r\n* Fix RTC time injection and consolidate position logic by @thebentern in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5396\r\n* Update arduino-pico core to fix sporadic hangs by @GUVWAF in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5406\r\n* Update platform-raspberrypi also by @GUVWAF in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5407\r\n* --web added to device-install(.sh/.bat) by @gjelsoe in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5405\r\n* Fixed NMEA sentence issue in CalTopo as well as bug with no printing all of the nodes by @thebentern in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5412\r\n* --web littlefswebui-* typo fix by @gjelsoe in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5416\r\n* Temporarily disable MDNS when MQTT is enabled on RP2040 by @GUVWAF in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5418\r\n* Seems like the last DIY board that's not \"extra\" by @jp-bennett in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5420\r\n* Cherry pick tdeck fixes by @thebentern in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5422\r\n* Update build-native.sh by @madeofstown in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5415\r\n* Cleans up visibility in GPS.h by @charlieh0tel in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5426\r\n* Fix admin key loading from userPrefs.h by @Mictronics in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5417\r\n* Try to detect dfrobot station to tell it apart from an ublox gps. by @caveman99 in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5393\r\n* Remove BMA-423 and STK8X by default by @thebentern in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5429\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @cpatulea made their first contribution in https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/5386\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/compare/v2.5.13.1a06f88...v2.5.14.f2ee0df"
