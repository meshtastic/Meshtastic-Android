        If you can't cause the bug to show up again reliably (and hence don't have a proper set of steps to give us), please still try to give as many details as possible on how you think you encountered the bug.

      description: |
        Logs help us to diagnose and reproduce issues, particularly when they are unique to your setup.
        Depending on the issue, the following logs may be useful:
        - App logs: This will help with most issues. If possible, provide the relevant output of:
            `adb logcat -d | grep com.geeksville.mesh`
        - Mesh logs:  UI issues, communication issues etc.
          - ` App > Settings > Advanced >  Debug Panel > Export specific / export all `
        - Broader Android logs: Potentially useful if the issue goes beyond the app (connections, network etc.)
             `adb logcat -d`
        - Firmware logs: Useful for all connection issues with nodes
          - These are piped to the USB serial port on the node, the most foolproof is to use the 'open serial' button on the web-flasher interface, and then save the output.
            - The app needs to be connecting to the node via Bluetooth or Network for this to work.
